\begin{frame}{Abstract}{}

  \begin{itemize}

      \item{ Explore whether we can create a solid recommendation system based on user high user ratings/reviews on certain products}
      
      \item{ Collaborative filtering - technique commonly used for recommendation systems.}
      
      \item{ Model based - develop descriptive model of user ratings with ML approaches. Use generated model for future prediction on the user's preference}
 
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Motivation}{}

  \begin{itemize}

      \item{ Who are the users of this analytic?}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item {E-commerce sites that are exploring better recommendation systems}
      \end{itemize}
      \item{ Who will benefit from this analytic?}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item {E-commerce sites - sell more products and improve user experience}
          \item{Site users/buyers - get recommended with products they may be interested in, better experience}
      \end{itemize}
      
      \item{ Why is this analytic important?}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item {E-commerce sites are a big part of our community and economy now.}
          \item{Advantage of directly recommended items to make up for lack of browsing efficiency like in real store.}
      \end{itemize}
 
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Goodness}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {
    Data from reliable E-commerce sources (Amazon, Yelp)
  }
  \item {   
    Data split into training and testing and validation segments
  }
  \item {
    RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) 
  }
  \item {
    Looking and personal intuition
  }
  \end{itemize}

          \item {Amazon data provided by Dr. Julian McAuley from UCSD}
          \item{Consists of: \textbf{reviewerID}, \textbf{asin} (Amazon Standard Identification Number), reviewerName, helpful, \textbf{stars}, reviewText, \textbf{overall} (rating), summary, unixReviewTime, reviewTime}
          \item {Size of Data: 6.6GB of review data, 1.2GB of metadata used}

        \item {Platform: Hive and MLlib ran on NYU HPC Cluster - Dumbo}

        \item{Dataset split into $60\%$ for training, $20\%$ for testing and $20\%$ for validation}

            Low-rank matrix factorization 
            $$U[i] = \min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^d} \sum_{j \in Nbrs(i))} (r_{ij} - w^TV^T[j])^2 + \lambda \left \| w \right \|^2_2$$
            
            Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) amplifies and severely punishes large errors comparing to Mean Absolute Error
            $$RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}$$

      }
      \item {
        Most places in the input data is in NV and AZ.
      }
      \item {
        Results are mostly in NV and AZ as well, which helps us think that our results are semi-reliable through intuition.

      \item {
        From the user's input data we notice makeup and woman shirts among other woman products.  But this woman also seems to enjoy certain pro-shop past times, maybe hunting or shooting, because of 5 star dart rating and pro shop apron.
      }
      \item {
        Some of the results are either woman products such as beauty products and woman clothes, but in there are also some pro shop items such as fishing gear.

        It's harder to use intuition to validate Amazon results.

\begin{frame}{Obstacles}

  \begin{itemize}
      \item { MLlib's ALS algorithm training function asks for Java int variables as its mapped training data, and so our alpha-numeric ids for Yelp data do not work without some data manipulation }
      \item { java heap space out of memory for Amazon Data, This is because the available free memory on HPC is too low, and we have too much data, works if we significantly cut down our data}
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Summary}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item{
    We trained our models on the training set and selected the best model on the validation set based on the lowest RMSE.  The best model is then evaluated on our test set.
    }
  \item {
    We were able to get recommendations for both yelp and amazon data using CF and MLlib's ALS algorithm
    }
    \item{
    To verify if these recommended items are true or false really depends on the user himself
    }
